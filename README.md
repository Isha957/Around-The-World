# Around The World [ Capstone Project ]
This is the Capstone Project done to find the art venues in famous cities with  various countries around the world. Using the help of Foursquare API and IBM Watson, I have been able to make calls and explore further details regarding these venues. that would help art seekers, travelers and travelling businesses to find some of the specific factors that might attract tourists.
It is a clustering based project used to search and explore various cities.
